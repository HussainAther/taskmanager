Project Idea: Personal Task Manager

Description:
Create a personal task manager application where users can create, update, and delete tasks. Users will need to register and log in to access their tasks.

Features:

User Authentication:

Implement user registration and login functionality using Flask for the backend.
Store user credentials securely in a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL).
Front End:

Use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end design.
Implement React with Material-UI for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Full CRUD Operations:

Create: Allow users to create new tasks by entering a task description and due date.
Read: Display a list of tasks for each user, showing the task description and due date.
Update: Enable users to edit task details such as description and due date.
Delete: Allow users to delete tasks from their task list.
API Calls:

Use Flask to create API routes to handle HTTP requests from the front end.
Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
Use Axios or Fetch API in React to make API calls to these endpoints.
Additional Ideas to Enhance the Project:

Implement task categories or labels to organize tasks.
Add a priority level to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) and allow users to sort tasks based on priority.
Implement task filtering or searching functionality.
Enable users to mark tasks as completed.
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for better task list navigation.
